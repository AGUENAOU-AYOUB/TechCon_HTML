            alt="Historical timeline showing TechCon's evolution from a small meetup to a major international conference">
        <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 50 passionate technologists in a modest conference room in Silicon
            Valley. What started as an informal meetup to discuss emerging technologies has evolved into one of the world's
            premier technology conferences, attracting over 10,000 attendees annually.</p>
    
        <p>Over the years, TechCon has been at the forefront of technological innovation, providing a platform for
            groundbreaking announcements and fostering connections that have led to revolutionary partnerships. From the
            early days of discussing cloud computing to today's focus on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and
            sustainable technology, TechCon has consistently remained ahead of the curve.</p>
